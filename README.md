## Requirements

- 64 bits OS
- Windows 7 SP1/Windows 8/Windows 10 1803+
- Ubuntu 16.04+
- **8 GB** of RAM or more.

> âš  **N versions of Windows 10** require installing the [Media Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack).

## GPU Processing Requirements

- NVIDIA Graphics card with CUDA compatibility
- [Latest NVIDIA drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

> ðŸ‘‰ If you do not have an NVIDIA or compatible graphics card you can use CPU processing.

## F.A.Q.

**Q: Why does the program ask for firewall permissions?**

A: For now the GUI needs to create a local server on your computer to render the interface of the program, basically the GUI is a web browser. Yes I am aware that this method is "retarded" but it is temporary. No, it's not a virus, a botnet or anything like that, I'm not interested in your photos or your files.

# ðŸ’» Development > ðŸš§ Area only for developers!

## Requirements

- [CUDA 10.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive)
- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)
- [NodeJS 10+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## What should I know?

- [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python): For the development of the CLI, the transformation algorithm and the neural network.
- [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css), [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript): For website development (The GUI is a website ðŸ˜®)
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/): The frameworks that have been used to build the GUI. _(VueJS is the best #changemymind)_
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/): The software used to "transform" the GUI from a website to a desktop program.

## Setup

> All the source code is inside the src/ folder, from now on all the instructions will be based on this folder.

### Quick Setup

Inside the folder `scripts/` you will find folders for the different supported operating systems, within each folder there is a series of scripts that will allow you to prepare the project for its development.

- **setup**: This script will install all the necessary requirements for Python and NodeJS. In theory you only need to run this script once per version.
- **build**: This script will compile the project in the `dist/` folder (generate the binaries for CLI and GUI), once finished you can compress the `dist/` folder and share it with the world.
- **dev-start**: This script will launch 2 processes, one to start the NuxtJS server (which will compile all the CSS, JavaScript and Vue files) and other that will start Electron that will load the NuxtJS server. Any change you make in `gui/` will be reflected in real time.

> âš  If you use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or some other program that encapsulates Python or NodeJS in their own development environment it is very likely that these scripts fail, you will have to read the content and execute the commands manually.

> âš  The NuxtJS server incorporates an HTTP server to view the live application in a web browser, **you must not access the web address indicated by the console**, the application only works when it is opened from Electron.

> ðŸ‘‰ The scripts for **macOS** are the same as those for Linux. [More information](src/scripts/mac/README.md).

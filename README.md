## Installation

- **Windows:** Just click on the installer. ![](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/382463/1)
- **Linux:** Install using [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd). You can use the command: `sudo snap install <DreamTime>.snap --dangerous`. 
  - The `dangerous` argument is required to allow the installation of an application without a certificate, we will try to solve this in later versions.
- **macOS:** Install in the way other applications are installed. You may have to start DreamTime manually using the context menu while pressing the `shift` key.

## Common problems.

- **The installer displays the message "Installation aborted"**
  - Platform: **Windows**.
  - Cause: Known issue when upgrading from version 1.2 (or earlier) to a new version.
  - Solution:
    - Uninstall any instance of the application and try to re-install in both modes (`Only for me` or `For all users`)
    - Install [Bulk Crap Uninstaller](https://www.bcuninstaller.com/) and remove any trace of DreamTime using the program, then try to re-install.

- **Errors related to `disableHardwareAcceleration` and `uploadMode`**
  - Platform: **Any**.
  - Cause: DreamTime was unable to update the user settings file with additional options required by the new version.
  - Solution: Open `%appdata%/dreamtime` (Windows) or click on the `App` button of DreamTime in the `About` section within the application and delete the `settings.json` file, then open DreamTime again.

## Manual

In each update we add new features that make the program a bit more complex, we invite you to read the manual so you don't miss out and take advantage of all the features:

## F.A.Q.

**Q: Why does the program ask for firewall permissions?**

A: We use [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) and [Nucleus](https://nucleus.sh/) to obtain telemetry information of the program mainly for automatic error reporting and to obtain real-time application information.

We do not store any personal information or photos that have been processed with the program, everything is kept securely on your computer, if you prefer you can use the program in offline mode or disable telemetry.
